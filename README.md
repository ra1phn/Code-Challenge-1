# Code-Challenge-1

## Chai Ingredients Project

This challenge involves creating a simple calculator to determine the basic ingredients needed to make a specific number of cups of Kenyan chai.

#### The Standard Recipe for 1 Cup of Chai:
* Water: 200 ml
* Milk: 50 ml
* Tea Leaves (Majani): 1 tablespoon
* Sugar (Sukari): 2 teaspoons (optional, but included for this challenge)

#### What I did:
I wrote a JavaScript function named `calculateChaiIngreditents` that:
1. **Prompts the user** to enter number of cups they want to make. 
2. Takes `numberOfCups` as an arguement(number). 
3. **Calculates** the required amount for each ingredient based on the arguement.
4. **Prints the results** to the console in a clear, readable format.

#### Example Interaction:
* **User is prompted:** `Karibu! How many cups of Chai Bora would you like to make?`
* **User enters:** `3`
* **Console Output:** <br>
> To make 3 cups of Kenyan Chai, you will need: <br>
> Water: 600 ml <br>
> Milk: 150 ml <br>
> Tea Leaves (Majani): 3 tablespoons <br>
> Sugar (Sukari): 6 teaspoons <br>
> 
> Enjoy your Chai Bora! <br>
